##### • Each digit occurs exactly once in each row (that is, no row contains any digit more than once.
##### • Each digit occurs exactly once in each column.
##### • Each digit occurs exactly once in each submatrix.
##### An almost-completed Sudoku puzzle is similar, except that one or two elements are unspecified.
